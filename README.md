## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/notes-chat-assistant.git
cd notes-chat-assistant
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Add your notes

Add your structured notes to:

```
backend/data/month3_notes.json
```

Sample format:

```json
{
  "interviewPreparation": [
    {
      "category": "JavaScript Basics",
      "items": ["Closure", "Hoisting", "Event Loop"],
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is hoisting?",
          "guidance": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use your assistant.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* The app first tries to answer your query using a **LangChain retrieval chain**.
* If it fails or returns nothing, it uses a **custom fallback search** from `month3_notes.json`.
* Chat messages are displayed in a clean UI.

---

## 📌 Example Usage

Type something like:

> "What is hoisting?"
> "Explain event loop in JavaScript"

The assistant will search and reply using your notes!

---

## 🧪 Future Ideas

* Integrate real embeddings from OpenAI or Cohere
* Add login support with Firebase
* Save chat history
* Support PDF or Markdown notes
